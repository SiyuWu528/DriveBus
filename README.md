I design and develop models capable of emulating human-like game playing behaviors through interaction with unaltered interface. Each model is designed to represent a specific type of human behavior observed during gameplay. These models were constructed using the ACT-R cognitive architecture and incorporate perceptual-motor knowledge of the virtual environment!
